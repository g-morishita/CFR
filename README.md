# What's This?
This repository is implementations of algorithms to calculate Nash equilibria (NE).
I implement them in Python.
It is not efficient, but easy to read.

# Algorithm to implement
## Regret Matching 
This is a fundamental algorithm to seek for a correlated equilibrium which is a weaker concept of NE in a normal-form game.

### How to use
Move to `regret_in_games/src`, then just run `python main.py game_name`, where game_name is one you want to simulate.
The requirement is python3.7 and some basic packages such as numpy, and pandas.
